== Use cases

=== Find number of times vacancies been viewed (not great for performance - wide reaching)
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (vac:Vacancy)<-[viewCount:HAS_VIEWED]-(candidate:Candidate)
RETURN vac.name, sum(viewCount.count);
----
//table

=== Increment the number of times each user has viewed each vacancy
[source,cypher]
----

MATCH (v:Vacancy)
MATCH (c:Candidate)
MERGE (c)-[hv:HAS_VIEWED]->(v)
	ON CREATE SET hv.count = 1 
	ON MATCH SET hv.count = hv.count + 1
RETURN hv;

=== Number of views per vacancy for each candidate
