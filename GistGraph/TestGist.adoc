== Use cases

=== Find number of times a vacancy has been viewed (not great for performance as a wide reaching / unbounded query)
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (vac:Vacancy)<-[viewCount:HAS_VIEWED]-(candidate:Candidate)
RETURN vac.name as Vacancy, sum(viewCount.count) as ViewCount
ORDER BY vac.name;
----
//table

=== Increment the number of times each user has viewed vacancies they have already seen 
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Candidate)
MERGE (c)-[hv:HAS_VIEWED]->(v:Vacancy)
	ON CREATE SET hv.count = 1 
	ON MATCH SET hv.count = hv.count + 1
RETURN c.name as Candidate, v.name as Vacancy, hv.count as ViewedCount;
----
//table

=== Increment times specific vacancy viewed by specific candidate
[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (c:Candidate {name:"Candidate 1"} )-[hv:HAS_VIEWED]->(v:Vacancy {name:"Vacancy 4"} )
	ON CREATE SET hv.count = 1

//table

=== Number of views per vacancy for each candidate
